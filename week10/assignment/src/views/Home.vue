 <h1>Megan's Pyrex Passion</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my collection of vintage Pyrex Bakeware patterns</h2>
    <p>My passion for Pyrex began with the iconic Amish Butterprint Mixing Bowl Set, which I inherited from my great grandmother. My initial goal was to find the other bowls to complete the set. But before I knew it, I was hooked and began trying to collect all opal Pyrex items produced from the 1940s-1980s.</p>
