    "projectStatement": "The overall Goal for this prompt was to design a travel postcard to a fictional location of our own creation. The design parameters and overall focus was the type and what it says about our location. The imagery added to the card should only lend to the card and not overly dominate the piece distracting from the type. My fictional location is an island in the Mediterranean sea inspired by the coastal villages of Italy called Venetio. It is full of vibrant colors, vintage elegance and the nostalgic charm of traveling in the 1930s/40s.",
    "projectChallenges": "It was a struggle to avoid relying on imagery to fill spaces and not enough on the type which is the focus of this piece.",
    "projectSolutions": "I was able to push past these struggles by playing with scale and letters of type. I inverted the city name in on itself to give a stamped quality of the old world. I was inspired to create a piece with vibrant colors, clean lines, and elegant typography choices and the juxtaposition of elements on the page. My framework for deciding the elements of design for this project was to capture the essence of the island. I created a list of attributes that I wanted to emphasis and the mood that I wanted to capture. My projectGoal was to evoke an exuberant and playful tone with hints of modernism sprinkled in the design. I was inspired by collage artwork to bring in the flavor of the island. I focused on design principles such as framing, color theory, repetition and symmetry to bring balance to my composition. I chose Savour Sans because of its clean simple letterforms that had an aire of sophistcation that I wanted to echo throughout the postcard. The rounded letters had an art deco feel that paired well with the era of design. I chose Casagrande Deco regular a sans serif font for the body copy of the postcard as it paired well with the serif font of the city name."

    "projectCategory": "Graphic Design",
    "projectStatement": "Our brief was to create a design system for a fiction magazine. The assets included a cover, table of contents, one page article and a feature article. I chose a niche wedding market that focused on destination mountain weddings in the Pacific Northwest.The primary audience for this magazine is upper-middle class women ages 25-35 looking to plan a unique mountain wedding. This magazine will be printed quarterly to feature seasonal changes that go along with wedding planning.",
    "projectChallenges": "Designing the style guide for the magazine really made me think about the overall structure and the hierarchy of the content in the magazine and forced me to justify my design choices. This meant going back to the drawing board for some of the pieces I designed and work within the grid system I developed.",
    "projectSolutions": "This essentially involved setting up a grid system, type choices and overall brand identity that would allow for future designers to step in and maintain the overall brand image. The design of this magazine focuses on photography to draw the attention its readers and type to lend to each image. The magazine will feature several travel pieces that focus. The overall layout of this magazine is very photo heavy and is an essential piece of the magazines brand image. This project focused on creating a design grid system that can be recycled while still providing a fresh look for each issue. I developed a style guide to assist with the type and imagery that is to be used in every issue."

    "projectCategory": "Graphic Design",
    "projectStatement": "My project initiative was to brand a fictional restaurant and to create a system focused on typography. My fictional kitchen was inspired London and Paris bistros. My overall projectGoal for this project was to create a branding system that was elegant and modern in order to cater to an ever diversifying market of dine-in, takeout and meal kits. This was my first exercise creating designs that integrating type and design.",
    "projectChallenges": "It was a challenge to steer myself away from the overall design and focus more on typography. Only once I started sketching out possible logos did my vision of this restaurant start to clarify through the type. My biggest struggle with this project was digitizing my logo but I was able to get there in the end my using my drawing tablet.",
    "projectSolutions": "It was fun to sketch out different types and try a variety of different styles to create an overall classic and bold feel. I chose an elegant serif font in gold leaf for the color as it is timeless and elegant. I chose to design the type against a deep blue background to give the gold a rich feel and incorporated greys into my medium as well in some of my assets to achieve the more modern feel I was looking for. Darker colors are more prominent in French culture and were used to help create an ambiance of an upscale restaurant. My table menu that is designed for a more personal formal dining experience my menu is to be printed on a heavy weighted paper on a 10 x 14 inches with a glossy finish and bound in a thin black wooden holder. For the wall signage to be used on to-go side of the restaurant I redesigned the formal menu with the dark grey and blues to give a more modern feel to the busy lunch customers coming in for a quality meal. I used gold lettering for food categories in order to tie in with the overall theme and provide visual interest in a darker background. The overall projectGoal of the wall signs here was to offer some quick carryout options for busy workers to grab a more healthy lunch and avoid the typical sitdown experience. Lastly is the our story sign which is printed on white paper overlayed with a glass cover with gold knobs set on a wooden board overlayed with a textured blue paper."
